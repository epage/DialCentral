Ideas
=================
User Contacts
	It seems the evolution contact API used is specific to the desktop.  evolution.ebook combined with abook is what is needed for Maemo.

	Other possible addressbooks
		GMail http://libgmail.sourceforge.net/
		GPE

Internet Connection
	Look into being a bit more advanced, beyond just enabling/disabling the GUI
	Possible Approach:
		Defer login
		While not logged in or device is offline, disable the GUI
		Don't attempt to login if not online

Keep callbacks to a minimum amount of blocking I/O

Re-examine all use of add_idle
	I dont think its a thread but idle processing in mainloop, so it could block for long execution
